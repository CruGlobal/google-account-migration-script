## requirements

You must have a modern (2.1+) version of ruby and the chromedriver installed on your path (https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver)

You must also copy the `config.json` file (which you can get from Spencer) into the root of this project.

## install

`bundle install`

## running

`ruby auto.rb`

This will run one dry run. Once you are comfortable, you can turn off dry-run inside the `auto.rb` file.
